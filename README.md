# WaterQualityMonitoring

This project was build using turbidity sensor module and a temperature sensor(DS18B20) to measure the quality of water .
Turbidity is measuring of cloudiness or haziness of water in terms of NTU (nephelometric turbidity unit), so when a light beam is passed through water it scatters at 90
degrees the more the light scatters the dirtier the water is
so we made a whole setup of this particular project which will be uploading soon.

Requirements:

hardware:
1. turbidity module
2. temperature sensor
3. breadboard
4. jumper wires
5. PC
6. arduino UNO

software:
1. arduino
